# WhatsappMessenger
The functions provided with WhatsAppMessenger are there to help you to write automated Whatsapp Messenges via WhatsAppWeb. I'm using the Selenium library to interact with WhatsAppWeb. If you want to this to work you will have to install the selenium library using `pip install selenium`on Windows or `python -m pip install selenium`on MacOs and Linux.
